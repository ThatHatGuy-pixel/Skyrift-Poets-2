<h4>Skylanders was a huge part of my childhood, I'm part of the small 
    chunk of the fanbase that became a fan 3 years, (give or take), before the franchise ended. Meaning, unlike the majority of fans, I am currently a teenager. <h5 style="color: #801d16;">(will be relevant later)</h5> 
    <br>
<h4>I distinctly remember walking into EB games with my family. Seeing Skylanders I would have killed for, piled in tubs in the middle of the store. Cheap price 
    tags gripped the grey plastic that each figurine was now stored in. The cashier told us that Skylanders were being discontinued. 
<br>
<br>
Many years later, I was curious why this seemingly gold mine of a game idea died, so I did some digging. To properly convey the importance of this mark in gaming history, 
    we must start at the beginning, the VERY beginning.

        I also added the initial character controller and experimented with lighting effects.
        More visual updates coming soon!
