    <h1>What happened to Skylanders?</h1>
    <p class="post-date">24 Jul 2025</p>

    <p>
<h4>Skylanders was a huge part of my childhood, I'm part of the small 
    chunk of the fanbase that became a fan 3 years, (give or take), before the franchise ended. Meaning, unlike the majority of fans, I am currently a teenager. <h5 style="color: #801d16;">(will be relevant later)</h5> 
    <br>
<h4>I distinctly remember walking into EB games with my family. Seeing Skylanders I would have killed for, piled in tubs in the middle of the store. Cheap price 
    tags gripped the grey plastic that each figurine was now stored in. The cashier told us that Skylanders were being discontinued. 
<br>
<br>
Many years later, I was curious why this seemingly gold mine of a game idea died, so I did some digging. To properly convey the importance of this mark in gaming history, 
    we must start at the beginning, the VERY beginning.

<h4><To begin our journey, we actually can't start with the first Skylanders game, instead we go all the way back to 1998 when Spyro the Dragon was first released at the E3 convention in Atlanta, Georgia. The game was originally 
    developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, exclusively for PlayStation. It was a 3D platformer game with hub worlds and interconnected levels, you could even fly around parts of the map. 
    The game was a massive hit and many OG fans have fond memories of playing this game, additionally the distinct character design of their main character, Spyro. Already from the image notice his body is very cartoonish 
    and, no, he's not Barney, in fact the purple and orange colours remained a staple in every configuration of Spyro.

From 1998 - 2004, eight Spyro the Dragon games were released and the series 'ended'. However, in 2011 a video game development company named Toys for Bob needed to impress Activision, a leading worldwide distributor of games, 
    and revived the Spyro series. Robert Leyland, a technical engineer at Toys for Bob, (unofficially) walked into his workshop and walked out out with a fucking revolutionary product. He used the idea of RFID chips and 
    combined them with toys to be placed on a scanner and appear in game. This idea began the spark to one of the biggest trends in gaming history: Toys to life.
